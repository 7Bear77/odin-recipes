    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Flapjacks, or <em>Pancakes</em> if you prefer are delicious fluffy cakes that go well with butter and syrup.</p>
    <p>Often these delicious cakes are inexpensive to make, and very filling. We made this as the only item for dinner on the night in question, and I was <strong>stuffed</strong> when dinner was finished.</p>
    <p>The best way to eat these guys is fresh, but if you need to keep them warm while you make other food, or clean up the dishes you've made, a great way to do that is to preheat your oven to 350deg F, then once it's heated turn the oven off and set your Flapjacks inside. They will stay warm without drying out, and you can have dinner with a clean sink.</p>
    <h3>Method of Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your pan on your stove with oil of choice to medium to medium-high heat. You want an evenly heated pan.</li>
        <li>The more oil that's in the pan, the more likely it is to come out looking like the pancake in the picture below. If there is less oil, it will come out more evenly colored. Use this knowledge to craft <em>YOUR</em> perfect Flapjack.</li>
        <li>Pour your batter into the pan swiftly, the less total time pouring the better your Flapjack will turn out.</li>
        <li>Flip when you can see bubbles on most or all of the surface of the batter. If you had more oil there is a chance that you will not see bubbles around the middle-edges, this is okay.</li>
        <li>Wait around 60-90 seconds before removing Flapjack from heat. You want to try and leave it on the heat for as long as possible before checking it.</li>
        <li>Use a stopwatch if you can to get more consistent pancakes. We found that flipping at 60 seconds and removing at 120 seconds gave us the best looking Flapjacks for our pan on our stove.</li>
        <li><strong>OPTIONAL</strong>: you can butter your Flapjacks while they are still on the heat! This gives both a faster butter melt, and a more consistent one.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The bottom line is that we found the most success with Flapjacks by timing them and cooking them with a consistent amount of heat. REALLY let your pan heat up, or you will have inconsistent cakes.

        You will be mixing ingredients in two separate bowls. Be sure to keep the wet ingredients separate from the dry ones.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>cooking spray or oil of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until no lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Add milk, eggs, and oil; whisk until batter is runny and smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, ladle a generous 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto the preheated grill and cook until bubbles appear, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook, pressing middle gently with the spatula, until bottom is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
