        <h2 class="description flap">Description</h2>
        <p class="para flap">Flapjacks, or <em>Pancakes</em> if you prefer are delicious fluffy cakes that go well with butter and syrup.</p>
        <p class="para flap">Often these delicious cakes are inexpensive to make, and very filling. We made this as the only item for dinner on the night in question, and I was <strong>stuffed</strong> when dinner was finished.</p>
        <p class="para flap">The best way to eat these guys is fresh, but if you need to keep them warm while you make other food, or clean up the dishes you've made, a great way to do that is to preheat your oven to 350deg F, then once it's heated turn the oven off and set your Flapjacks inside. They will stay warm without drying out, and you can have dinner with a clean sink.</p>

    <h3 class="flap method">Method of Cooking</h3>
    <ol class="order list flap">
        <li class="list-item flap">Heat your pan on your stove with oil of choice to medium to medium-high heat. You want an evenly heated pan.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">The more oil that's in the pan, the more likely it is to come out looking like the pancake in the picture below. If there is less oil, it will come out more evenly colored. Use this knowledge to craft <em>YOUR</em> perfect Flapjack.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">Pour your batter into the pan swiftly, the less total time pouring the better your Flapjack will turn out.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">Flip when you can see bubbles on most or all of the surface of the batter. If you had more oil there is a chance that you will not see bubbles around the middle-edges, this is okay.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">Wait around 60-90 seconds before removing Flapjack from heat. You want to try and leave it on the heat for as long as possible before checking it.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">Use a stopwatch if you can to get more consistent pancakes. We found that flipping at 60 seconds and removing at 120 seconds gave us the best looking Flapjacks for our pan on our stove.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap"><strong>OPTIONAL</strong>: you can butter your Flapjacks while they are still on the heat! This gives both a faster butter melt, and a more consistent one.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para flap">
        The bottom line is that we found the most success with Flapjacks by timing them and cooking them with a consistent amount of heat. REALLY let your pan heat up, or you will have inconsistent cakes.
        <br>
        You will be mixing ingredients in two separate bowls. Be sure to keep the wet ingredients separate from the dry ones.

    <h3 class="ingredients flap">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="unorder list flap">
        <li class="list-item flap">2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">2 cups milk</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">2 eggs</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">cooking spray or oil of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="order list flap">
        <li class="list-item flap">Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until no lumps remain.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">Add milk, eggs, and oil; whisk until batter is runny and smooth.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray.</li>
        <li class="list-item flap">Working in batches, ladle a generous 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto the preheated grill and cook until bubbles appear, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook, pressing middle gently with the spatula, until bottom is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve!</li>
